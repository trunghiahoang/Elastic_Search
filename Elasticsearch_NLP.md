As part of our Natural Language Processing (NLP) blog series, we'll introduce an example that uses a text embedding model to generate vector representations of text content and demonstrates a vector similarity search on the generated vectors. We will deploy a publicly available model on Elasticsearch and use it in the ingestion pipeline to generate embeddings from text documents. We then show how these embeddings can be used in vector similarity searches to find semantically similar documents for a given query. 

Vector similarity search , or commonly known as semantic search, goes beyond traditional keyword-based search and allows users to find semantically similar documents that may not have any keywords in common, thus providing a broader range of results. Vector similarity search operates on dense vectors and uses k-nearest neighbor search to find similar vectors. To do this, you first need to convert the content in the form of text into its numerical vector representation using a text embedding model. 

We will demonstrate using a public dataset from the MS MARCO Passage Ranking Task . It consists of real questions and human-generated answers from the Microsoft Bing search engine. This dataset is a perfect resource for testing vector similarity searches, firstly, because question answering is one of the most common use cases for vector search, and secondly, the top papers in the MS MARCO rankings use vector search in some form.

 In our example, we will use a sample of this dataset, use the model to generate text embeddings, and then run a vector search on it. We also wanted to quickly verify the quality of the results produced by the vector search. In today's demonstration, I will use Elastic Stack 8.2 to demonstrate. 

For a vector search, its architecture can be expressed as follows:

Install
 Elasticsearch Âèä Kibana

 If you have not installed your own Elasticsearch and Kibana, please refer to the following article to install it: 
 - How to install Elasticsearch on Linux, MacOS and Windows
 -  Kibana: How to install Kibana in the Elastic stack on Linux, MacOS and Windows 

Please note the 8.x installation section of the article. Since using eland to upload models is a function of the Platinum or Enterprise Edition, in our demonstration, we need to enable the Platinum Edition trial function:
